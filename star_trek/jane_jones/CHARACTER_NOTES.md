## Intrusions

### Player

#### Fortuitous Malfunction

A trap or a dangerous device malfunctions before it can affect you.

#### Serendipitous Landmark

Just when it seems like the path is lost (or you are), a trail marker, a
landmark, or simply the way the terrain or corridor bends, rises, or falls away
suggests to you the best path forward, at least from this point.

#### Weak Strain

The poison or disease turns out not to be as debilitating or deadly as it first
seemed, and inflicts only half the damage that it would have otherwise.

### GM

GM Intrusions: The dangers of the high seas are many, including severe storms
and disease. Other pirates sometimes get ahead through betrayal. A pirate tracks
down former sailing mates to find hidden treasure.
