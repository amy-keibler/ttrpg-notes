Action to initiate.

### Find the Way

When you apply Effort to a navigation task because you don’t know the way, are
lost, are attempting to blaze a new route, need to choose between two or more
otherwise similar paths to take, or something very similar, you can apply a free
level of Effort. Enabler.

### Knowledge Skills

You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two
areas of knowledge such as history, geography, archeology, and so on. You can
select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two
different skills. Enabler.

objects right in front of someone’s eyes. Action.

select different skills each time. Enabler.

## Intrusions

### Player

#### Fortuitous Malfunction

A trap or a dangerous device malfunctions before it can affect you.

#### Serendipitous Landmark

Just when it seems like the path is lost (or you are), a trail marker, a
landmark, or simply the way the terrain or corridor bends, rises, or falls away
suggests to you the best path forward, at least from this point.

#### Weak Strain

The poison or disease turns out not to be as debilitating or deadly as it first
seemed, and inflicts only half the damage that it would have otherwise.

### GM

Thieves are thrown in jail. Powerful enemies are made.
