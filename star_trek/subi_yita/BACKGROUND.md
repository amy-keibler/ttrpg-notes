# Background

## Link To Starting Adventure

One of the PCs (Noak) asked you to come along, believing that your talents would
be invaluable to the mission.

## Connection to other PC

Pick one other PC (Eloise, Eryn's character). Based on a couple of comments
you’ve overheard, you suspect that they don’t hold your area of training or
favorite hobby in the highest regard. Specifiically, smuggling for the Maquis.
